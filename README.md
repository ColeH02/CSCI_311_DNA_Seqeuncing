Authors: Cole Zehe, Cole Hausman, Rob Barlow, Nick Satriano

### Github Repository for Our Code:
https://github.com/colezehe/CSCI311_DNA_Sequencing/

### How to Run and Understand Our Code:
1) Open your favorite IDE for running Python code
2) _CSCI311_DNA_Sequencing/src/main/python_ contains all the code for this project
4) Subfolder _/src/main/python/FileHandling_ contains code for interpreting text files in FASTA format, as well as the txt files with a sample dataset and query that were given for this project.

### How to Interact with Our Programs

_src/main/python/FileHandling/FileHandlingMain.py_
  - Contains functions for reading in DNA sequences
  - Follows the FASTA format required

_/src/main/python/LCSubString.py_
  - Contains code for finding the longest common substring
  - Inputs are two strings s1 and s2
