DNA Sequencing programs for CSCI 311 Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Authors: Cole Zehe, Cole Hausman, Rob Barlow, Nick Satriano

### Github Repository for Our Code:
https://github.com/colezehe/CSCI311_DNA_Sequencing/

### How to Run and Interact with Our Code:
1) Open your favorite IDE for running Python code
2) _CSCI311_DNA_Sequencing/src/main/python_ contains all the code for this project
3) _/src/main/python/UserInterface.py_ contains the main code for interacting with our programs. This is the code you want to run in order to interact with our interface and choose different algorithms.

### How to Understand Our Programs

_/src/main/python/UserInterface.py_
  - Contains the main loop for the user to interact with our algorithms
  - Is what should be run by the user

_/src/main/python/FileHandling/FileHandlingMain.py_
  - Contains functions for reading in DNA sequences
  - Follows the FASTA format required

_/src/main/python/LCSubString.py_
  - Contains code for finding the longest common substring
  - Inputs are two strings s1 and s2
